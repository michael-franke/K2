** Editorial letter **

Dear Michael,

First of all, my sincere apologies for the delay with which I bring you this decision. We aim to come to a decision within 10 weeks, but this time it took us two and half times as long. I know of course how frustrating such delays can be.

On the plus side, I have some quite good news. I have received two reports on your manuscript and both reviewers are very happy with the revisions you and your co-authors have made. One referee advises me to accept the paper, while the other advises revise and resubmit. I find the latter a bit harsh: it is clear this work needs to be published, it is clearly a piece of work of a very high standard, and there are no clear insurmountable barriers for publication. So, I will accept your paper for publication pending some final revisions. It's hard to tell whether these revisions are minor or major; it all depends on your reaction to the main point made in reviewer 2's report. While I think the manuscript is closer to publication than this referee, I do agree with his/her assessment that it is very important to rethink what the main point of the article really is (or at least how that main point is presented). The nutshell of his/her point is this: the paper introduces a lot of fine-grained theoretical distinctions (on both sides of the divide), but few (none) of these distinctions are clearly valuable when seen in the light of the experimental results. As I think I wrote in the first action letter: there may be underlying sensitivities here that steer you in a certain direction, but I would like to ask two things of you: (1) have a good think about the balanced conclusion you draw (the data are hard for both sides of the theoretical divide --- reviewer 2: the data clearly favours grammaticalism) and address the reviewer's worry as good as you can (s/he can't be the only one interpreting your paper like that); (2) rethink the value of the fine-grained description of the landscape of theoretical options (section 3.1/3.2).
In sum, I believe reviewer 2's main point represents a likely common reaction from a specific corner of the field. You should either preempt such a reaction and provide a bit more discussion of why you present your conclusion in the way you do or, if you think this reaction is fully within reason change the paper according to this referee's wishes.
Perhaps you could propose a route ahead via email?

The comments of the referee(s) are included at the bottom of this letter. Please makes some revisions w.r.t. the minor comments as well. Practical details are enclosed below.

Once again, thank you for submitting your manuscript to the Journal of Semantics and I look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.

Best wishes,
Rick

Comments to the Author
As the previous Reviewer 1, I am very satisfied with this revision. It will not end the debate between "traditionalists" and "grammaticists" but it convincingly presents some phenomena that must be accounted for in any story, and it sets some interesting limits on what accounts are possible. There are instances of 'overkill' in the paper, e.g., regarding the prosodic/acoustic analyses of the recordings and the data analysis. But I can accept these as simply reflecting the authors' high standards.  Further, I now find that the Bayesian analysis, which I previously considered unnecessary and hard to follow, is now quite comprehensible, and that it does go beyond the superficial main finding in the data - the high frequency of  literal interpretations - and makes it clear that some secondary phenomena , such as the existence of some local interpretations of ES sentences have theoretical importance. It's a good paper that introduces a promising new technique and provides some important data.

I was very glad to see the non-embedded control experiment in Section 6. Its results have a glass half full, glass half empty character. The incremental verification task apparently does not unambiguously identify the preferred interpretation of "some" sentences - I doubt that its results will persuade people that the literal interpretation is the generally-preferred interpretation of simple "some" sentences - but the contrast between the data it provides and the data obtained for embedded implicatures does tell us that something different is going in in the two situations. 

My only caveats are minor.
1. Perhaps I am persistently misreading something, but on page 4, should it say that the dots on the right of each diagram (of Figure 1) are papers, and the dots on the left represent students?
2. It would help, in describing Figure 3, to mention that the sentences about them referred to letters and circles. 
3. Page 20, the Clifton et al. 2002 reference isn't really very relevant to the point being made. If the authors want to cite counterevidence, they would do better with Gilboy, E., Sopena, J., Clifton, C. Jr., & Frazier, L. (1995). Argument structure and association preferences in Spanish and English Compound NPs. Cognition, 54(131-167). But it's not necessary. The citation of Konieczny and  Hemforth says what needs to be said.
4. Page 41, bottom, the references to Figure 16c doesn't seem to be correct.

Comments to the Author
The authors have done a good job responding to the first round of feedback. As in the previous round of review, I believe the paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature on scalar strengthening, and that the paper should be published. However, I continue to believe there is room for improvement. Specifically, I believe the paper can be streamlined by taking fuller advantage of previous results, which I hope will also clarify the contributions that the paper makes. 

My most important comment, which I'll try to spell out in Section 1 below, is that the question-answer structure of the paper does not come across as cleanly as it should. To my mind, the paper aims to answer two questions: (i) Are embedded strengthenings licensed only under marked prosody, i.e., is the Prosodic Marking Hypothesis true? (ii) Are there preferences for the different readings predicted by theories of strengthening? If so, what are they, and how are they determined? I believe the paper answers (i) quite nicely, but it burdens the reader with too much irrelevant information in setting up and addressing the question (much of section 3 of the paper up to but not including section 3.3 on the Prosodic Marking Hypothesis). Concerning question (ii), the paper leaves it unresolved, which would be fine had the authors not mischaracterized the question by invoking the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis in the way that they did (as I hope to clarify below). If these issues could be resolved in a revised version, I would have no serious objection to publication.

Section 1: The question-answer structure of the paper

It will help me to discuss the paper's contributions by taking Chemla & Spector (2011, hf. CS) as relevant background, as they also aimed to detect embedded readings in AS and ES sentences and found results that are sometimes supported but sometimes challenged by the present authors. I focus here on ES sentences, in part because AS sentences are not ideal for teasing apart "grammaticalism" from "unrestricted traditionalism", for reasons discussed in CS and elsewhere. My aim here is to identify some of the important empirical results from the current paper, and to relate them to questions (i) and (ii) above:

Empirical Result (1): Like CS, but using a different method, the present authors find that embedded strengthenings are available.

Consequences of (1): This result supports two of CS's claims. First, it provides further evidence for embedded strengthening (and hence, on the face of it, against Traditionalism -- pending further clarification of "typicality"), though of course it leaves open the question in (i) above. Second, (1) provides further support for CS's claim that the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis is probably *not* the right disambiguation principle (see note 6 of CS, and CS's section 5.5.2). 

Empirical Result (2): The present authors find that embedded strengthenings are available independent of prosodic marking. This result is totally new, and is made possible by their new method (their Incremental Verification Task).

Consequences of (2): This result argues against the Prosodic Marking Hypothesis (cf. question (i) above).

(3) Empirical Result (3): The present authors find that the literal reading is preferred to the local reading, which is in stark opposition with what CS found. 

Consequences of (3): Given the discussion in (1) above, an obvious challenge is to explain what might have led to different preferences in CS's sample and the one in the present paper (cf. question (ii) above).

If my reading of the paper is correct, then several changes to the paper are in order. 

- First, I believe much of the discussion in section 3 concerning auxiliary assumptions should be shortened or even deleted entirely. To begin with, much of the discussion about Traditionalism seems irrelevant to me. The really important assumption here is the Prosodic Marking Hypothesis, which can be simply stated without bothering with the distinction between weak/strong and restricted/unrestricted traditionalism. In fact, so far as I can tell, nothing that the authors say later in the paper bears on these differences, in part because traditionalism qua core theory is inconsistent with the authors' results. Turning to grammaticalism, in light of the fact that the Strongest Meaning Hypothesis was already argued in CS to be inoperative (or at least, not dominant) in ES sentences, the authors' decision to take that as the most promising example of a disambiguation criterion seems unjustified. In sum, the authors introduce many discourse referents in section 3 corresponding to possible combinations of core theory + auxiliary assumptions (all the variants of traditionalism and the conjunction of grammaticalism and the SMH), and at the end of the paper we are reminded that CS already gave us reason to reject them all. This is not very cooperative. 

My concrete suggestion is to considerably shorten Section 3 by not getting into all the choice points concerning Traditionalism (weak/strong, restricted/unrestricted) or Grammaticalism (Magri/QUD/SMH). All of these are irrelevant to the Prosodic Marking Hypothesis, and in any event nothing new is discovered by paper's end about the right auxiliary assumptions, other than that the answer is unlikely to be straightforward (cf. the conflict with CS's results alluded to above).

- Second, the authors' abstract and the discussion in the paper make it clear that there are challenges for both traditionalism and grammaticalism. This is very important, but the authors' discussion makes it seem as though the challenges for the two approaches are more on a par than they actually are. Traditionalism (as a core theory) is inconsistent with the authors' data, and grammaticalism (as a core theory) is consistent with their data. Of course, grammaticalism is still in need of auxiliary assumptions to account for the data about preferences, but this should occasion no surprise. For example, last I checked the psycholinguistics community was still trying to figure out, say, how PP-attachment ambiguities are resolved; just because we don't know how, this does not lead anyone to suggest that syntactic theories that generate PP-attachment ambiguities are in need of "refinement", does it? 

My concrete suggestion is to rephrase the abstract and other relevant passages in the paper so that it does not misleadingly suggest that grammaticalism qua core theory faces any particular difficulty with the authors' results; what is missing here is a theory of preference, but this is needed for any theoretical approach to strengthening. For note that the discrepancy between CS's findings and the present authors' findings concerning preferences need to be accounted for one way or another; since this is a problem for everyone, I don't think it is fair to single out grammaticalism as being in need of refinement, at least not until it is shown that some other approach predicts the discrepancy between CS and the present authors' data on preferences.

Section 2: Minor comments/thoughts (feel free to ignore)

A: "Exactly one" as monotonic: The authors suggest, based on the "true" responses at Step 2, that some of their participants might have re-interpreted "exactly one" as "at least one." I'm wondering if there is a less radical way to make sense of their participants' behaviour: for what it's worth, my intuition is that there might be domain-restriction effects here. There is exactly one uncovered bell at Step 2; thus, the sentence is literally true under a reading in which the domain of the quantifier is restricted to this one individual. I'm not exactly sure how to dissociate this suggestion from the authors', and I of course wouldn't insist that the authors do this. I raise the idea here simply for their consideration. With this in mind, in future work perhaps the authors might consider examining what would happen if Step 1 were followed instead by what is currently Step 3. The domain-restriction proposal would predict less "true" responses here because now there are two bells that are salient in the domain, but an "at least one" reading would still easily permit a "true" response here. (Note that getting rid of the current Step 2 is largely harmless, since global readings were basically absent in this paradigm.)

B: The Strongest Meaning Hypothesis, Again: As I noted earlier, it does not seem appropriate to assume the SMH for this paradigm in light of CS's results and discussion. However, I should like to add that one has to be careful about what the SMH actually states when we consider exhaustification, and here perhaps CS themselves could have been more careful. When we compare the strength of various sentences that differ in the placement of EXH, we have to be careful about what the alternatives to EXH are. So far as I can tell, the SMH may well still be in the running as a disambiguation criterion, if only we could be sure what the alternatives are in any given experimental setup. Since we don't know this, we can't really be sure whether the SMH has been properly tested. 

Having said this, it's still not clear to me that there is any motivation to appeal to the SMH the way the authors do. Putting aside the issues raised earlier, it is important to note that the works that the authors cite were all very careful to limit the immediate applicability of the SMH to either reciprocals (Dalrymple et al.) or to plural predication more generally (Winter). One is of course welcome to try extending its applicability, but my reading of the literature is that the SMH was not intended as a general disambiguation principle (lest it run into well-known issues in other areas, e.g., preferences in scope-ambiguities).

C: "Ex ante" predictions: The authors in many places write that certain proposals are not formulated as "ex ante" predictions. But the predictions of all the theories the authors discuss are all fully predictive: given a sentence and a context, just about every theory of strengthening I know clearly predicts how a scalar sentence will be interpreted. Of course, in experimental settings many relevant features of the context are left open, and hence participants have to guess what context they're in (see e.g., Crain & Steedman, 1985). This is certainly the case for the author's experiment, in which many of the contextual features that are important for strengthening are unspecified (e.g., relevance, assumptions about the speaker's mental state, etc). But this is a general feature of psycholinguistic studies, is it not? If you leave open crucial contextual features, participants have to guess those values. Does this make the theories any less predictive? Is the difficulty in pinning down a context a difficulty for the theory or for the experimenter?
