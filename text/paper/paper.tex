\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This paper deals with the interpretation of two types of
sentences, namely:

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:AE}
  \mymark{All} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\AE)
\ex \label{bsp:GE} 
  \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\GE)
\end{exe}

\noindent In \as-sentences the scalar item \emph{some} like takes
scope under universal quantifier \emph{all}. In \es-sentences
\emph{some} takes scope under non-monotonic quantifier \emph{exactly
  one}. These sentences are interesting, because, according to current
pragmatic theorizing, they may have at least three conceivable
readings. The main question we are interested in here is which of
these three conceivable readings is available to subjects na\"{i}ve to
all pragmatic theory. We are moreover interested in the more refined
question which of the available readings na\"{i}ve subjects prefer.

What are the possible readings of \as- and \es-sentences? Scalar
\emph{some} is usually assumed to receive a semantic interpretation
similar to logical $\exists$, so that the sentence \emph{Some boys
  cried} is literally true in a situation where all boys cried. But it
is also known to invite upper-bounding inferences in plain utterances:

\begin{exe}
  \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Target} Hans solved some of the problems.
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature} $\implicates$ Hans solved some but not all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent The classical explanation of this inference, following the
pioneering work of \citet{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}, has it that
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature}) is a pragmatic inference, a so-called
\emph{quantity implicature}, derived by an abductive inference as the
best explanation of why am informed, knowledgable and cooperative
speaker has uttered (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target}) when she could also
have uttered the semantically stronger and relevant:\dn{redo labels of
  examples}

\begin{exe}
  \exr{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \exi{c.} \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative} Hans solved all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent If this upper-bounding inference would occur often and
systematically enough, then it may well be that also embedded
occurrences of \emph{some} get enriched, in some fashion or other, to
contribute the enriched meaning \emph{some but not all} also under the
scope of other logical operators. Indeed, even
\citeauthor{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve} envisaged this possibility when
he wrote: ``It may not be impossible for what starts life, so to
speak, as a conversational implicature to become conventionalized''
\citep[p.58]{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}. But then there are at least
three relevant candidate readings for \as- and \es-sentences: (i) a
\emph{literal reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}) and
(\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}) where \emph{some} has only its literal meaning;
(ii) a \emph{global reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Global}) and
(\ref{bsp:GE-Global}) where, according to the Gricean intuition, we
enrich utterances of (\ref{bsp:AE}) and (\ref{bsp:GE}) with the
negation of alternativ utterances of the corresponding sentences
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Alternative}) where
\emph{some} is replaced by \emph{all}; and also (iii) a \emph{local
  reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Local}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Local}) where
\emph{some} is read to mean \emph{some but not all} in the scope of
the embedding quantifier.

\end{exe}

\noindent Section~\ref{sec:get-know-your} will discuss these reading
in more detail and, by giving some helpful illustrations, make clear
that these readings are all distinct but logically dependent
on each other in interesting ways.

The empirical questions we would like to ask, namely (i) which of
these readings are available, and (ii) which of the available ones are
the preferred interpretations, are highly relevant because they lie at
the heart of the current debate about the exact location and nature of
the interface between semantics and pragmatics. There are three major
camps which are ---more or less fiercely--- involved in this border
war, all of which make different predictions about availability and
preferences of readings. We will give a more detailed description of
the various theoretical positions below in
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}, but on a first rough
approximation the situation is the following. 

Firstly, there are \mymark{pragmatic traditionalists} who seek to
conserve the spirit of \citeauthor{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}'s
(\citeyear{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}) original ideas as much as
possible
\citep[e.g.][]{Spector2006:Scalar-Implicat,Sauerland2004:Scalar-Implicat,Russell2006:Against-Grammat,vanRooijSchulz:ExhaustiveInterpretation,Geurts2010:Quantity-Implic,Franke2011:Quantity-Implic}. Traditionalists
happily acknowledge the existence of global readings, but might
consider local readings either unavailable or a beast distinct from
scalar implicatures. An often phrased intuition of the traditionalists
is that local readings, since they are special kinds of inferences,
require special intonation, in particular emphatic stress on the
scalar item.\dn{give references}

Opposed to that is the camp of \mymark{lexical conventionalists}
\citep[e.g.][]{LevinsonPresumptiveMeanings2000,Chierchia:2004_ScalarImplicatures}
who maintain that scalar \emph{some} is lexically ambiguous between
the standard logical meaning \emph{some and maybe all} and the
upper-bounded meaning \emph{some but not all}. As the latter is
considered a default, lexical conventionalism has no problem
accounting for local readings, and in fact would consider these the
preferred readings. 

Thirdly and finally, there is the camp of \mymark{grammaticalists} who
defend that the distribution of upper-bounded readings of \emph{some}
is best explained by postulating a silent operator, akin to the
meaning of the particle \emph{only}
\citep{Chierchia2006:Broaden-Your-Vi,Fox2007:Free-Choice-and,Sauerland2012:The-Computation,ChierchiaFox2008:The-Grammatical,Chierchia2012:FC-Nominals-and}. According
to the grammatical view, this silent operator may be applied in
compositional semantics also in the scope of other logical operators,
but, so as not to overgenerate readings, the availability of readings
is constraint by the \emph{strongest meaning hypothesis}
\citep{DalrympleKanazawa1998:Reciprocal-Expr}. Grammaticalist theories
predict that all three types of readings are available. Moreover,
according to the grammatical view, the local reading is preferred for
\as-sentences, while the global one is preferred for
\es-sentences. (More precisely, as we will see
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}, depending on the variant of
the strongest meaning hypothesis employed, either the global reading
is predicted to be preferred for \es-sentences, or the global and the
local reading are predicted to be equally preferred.)

Due to its theoretical significance, a number of previous studies have
already probed into the availability of readings for \as- and
\es-sentences
\citep[e.g.][]{GeurtsPouscoulous2009:Embedded-Implic,CliftonDube2010:Embedded-Implic,ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev}. However,
as we will argue in Section~\ref{sec:previous-studies}, results have
not been as clear-cut as one might have hoped for. Even worse so,
taken in conjunction, the empirical evidence is inconclusive as to
whether local readings exist. We hypothesized that previous studies
might be insufficiently informative because of the focus on (variants
of) a picture-verification paradigm.\dn{relate to Bob van Tiel's
  work}  The problem is that in order to test the availability of
different candidate meanings different pictures have to be presented,
so that effects of pictorial complexity or stereotypicality could
never be ruled out entirely. Moreover, previous studies have only
accumulated limited evidence pertaining to the second question that
may help decide between theoretical positions, namely which of the
attested readings subjects prefer.

In reaction to this situation, we therefore studied a different mode
of visual presentation: subjects were presented with pictures that
were partly covered and could incrementally be uncovered at the
subjects' request; for each ((partially) covered) picture, subjects
had to decide whether they could already give a truth-value judgement
or needed more information.\dn{mention who else does this} This way we
obtained behavioral data that is both indicative of the reading
subjects assumed and independent of the complexity of the visual
stimulus. At the same time, we hypothesized that the incremental
nature of this task would shed light on the preferences over readings,
because the temporal distribution of truth-value judgments would give
away which reading subjects were waiting to evaluate, so to speak. To
test whether our method is indeed suitable to detect interpretation
preferences, we included ambiguous test items like
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler}) which are known to preferentially
receive the late-closure reading in
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler-LC}) and not the dispreferred, but
attested early-closure reading
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler-EC}).\dn{insert references to
  literature on EC-LC processing}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler} The letter is connected with circles and squares with
  suns.
  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler-LC} The letter is connected
    with squares with suns and circles. \hfill (\LC)
  \ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler-EC} The letter is connected
    with circles with suns and squares with suns. \hfill (\EC)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent Finally, since it is often argued (see
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}) that intonational stress on an
embedded scalar item can favor a local reading we presented sentence
auditorily and manipulated stress accordingly. The design of our
studies is detailed in Section XYZ.

\begin{itemize}
\item summarize results
\end{itemize}

The paper is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sec:get-know-your}
elaborates on the three kinds of relevant readings for our target
sentences. Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions} works out the
different theoretical positions and their predictions about
availability and preference. Section~\ref{sec:previous-studies} recaps
the results of previous studies on this subject, arguing for the need
of a more refined methodology. Section~\ref{sec:design} describes our
experimental design. Section~\ref{sec:results} states our results,
which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.\dn{rephrase

\section{Get to know your readings}
\label{sec:get-know-your}

Three readings are \emph{prima facie} conceivable for the \as- and
\es-sentences in (\ref{bsp:AE}) and (\ref{bsp:GE}). These are
logically distinct, but also logically dependent in intricate ways. To
see this, let us look at each kind of sentence in turn.

\subsection{\as-sentences}
\label{sec:as-sentences}

An \as-sentence like (\ref{bsp:AE}) has a literal reading as in
(\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}), a global reading as in (\ref{bsp:AE-Global})
and a local reading as in (\ref{bsp:AE-Local}).

\begin{exer}{bsp:AE}

  \ex \mymark{All} of the students read {\mymark{some}} of the
  papers. 

  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \mymark{All} of the students read
    {\mymark{some and maybe all}} of the papers. \hfill (\as-\lit)
  \ex
    \mymark{All} of the students read \mymark{some and maybe all} 
    and  \hfill (\as-\glb)\\
    it's not the case that \mymark{all} of the students read \mymark{all} of the papers.
  \ex
    \mymark{All} of the students read {\mymark{some  but not all}} of the
    papers. \hfill (\as-\loc)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exer}

\noindent These readings stand in a strict entailment relation,
namely the local reading asymmetrically entails the global reading,
which asymmetrically entails the literal reading:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \label{bsp:Entailments-AS} \loc $\subset$ \glb $\subset$ \lit
\end{exe}
That \glb $\subseteq$ \lit is obvious, given that \glb is defined as the
conjunction of \lit and the negated (relevant/feasible) alternative(s)
of the to-be-interpreted utterance. The entailment is asymmetric,
because the information that not all of the students read all of the
papers is not entailed by the literal reading. To see that \loc
$\subset$ \glb, notice that the case where all of the students read
some but not all of the papers is a special case of the case where all
of the students read some (and maybe all), while not all of the
students read all of the papers.

Given these entailment relations, there are four kinds of situations,
the names for which we borrow from
\citet{ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev}, that we can distinguish
based on different truth values for our candidate readings:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    situation    & \multicolumn{3}{c}{truth value} 
  \\ 
  \cmidrule(r){2-4}
     & \lit & \glb & \loc \\ \midrule
    false   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    literal & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    weak    & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    strong  & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Examples of these kinds of situations are given in
Figure~\ref{fig:AS-distinguishing-pics}, where the dots on the right
of each diagram are students, the dots on the left problems and an
arrow from a student to a problem indicates that that student sovled
that problem.\dn{improve graphics} Notice that, except for the literal
situation in
Figure~\ref{fig:literal-AE},
other arrangements of arrows might equally well serve as examples.

  \caption{Distinguishing scenarious for \as-sentences}
  \label{fig:AS-distinguishing-pics}
\end{figure}


\subsection{\es-sentences}
\label{sec:es-sentences}

The situation for \es-sentences like (\ref{bsp:GE}) is similar, but a
little more complicated because the embedding quantifier is
non-monotonic. Again, we consider a literal reading as in
(\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}), a global reading as in (\ref{bsp:GE-Global})
and a local reading as in (\ref{bsp:GE-Local}).

\begin{exer}{bsp:GE}
\ex \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read {\mymark{some}} of the
  papers.

  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read
    {\mymark{some and maybe all}} of the papers. \hfill (\es-\lit)
  \ex 
    \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some and maybe all} 
    and  \hfill (\es-\glb)\\
    it's not the case that \mymark{exactly one} of the students read \mymark{all} of the papers.
  \ex 
    \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read {\mymark{some  but not all}} of the
    papers. \hfill (\es-\loc)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exer}

\noindent Entailment relations in this case are non-linear:
\begin{exe}
  \ex        \lit\ $\supset$ \glb\ $\color{mycol}{\subset}$ \loc 
    % \hspace{1cm} and \hspace{1cm}  \lit\ $\not \supset$ \loc
\end{exe}
Of course, $\glb \subseteq \lit$ by definition of global readings. But
the entailment is asymmetric, because the extra information that it is
not the case that exactly one student read all of the papers is not
entailed by the literal reading (\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}). However,
unlike for \as-sentences, \loc is not stronger than \glb, but
asymmetrically entailed by the latter. To see this, notice that the
global reading is equivalent to:

\begin{exe}
  \exp{bsp:GE-Global} \label{test} \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some but not
    all} and \\
  \mymark{everybody else} read \mymark{none} of the papers.
\end{exe}

\noindent This reformulation also makes clear that \loc and \lit are
logically independent.

Given these entailment relations, there are again four different
situations, named following \citet{ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev},
corresponding to the four possible distributions of truth values:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    situation    & \multicolumn{3}{c}{truth value} 
  \\ 
  \cmidrule(r){2-4}
    & \textsc{lit} & \textsc{glb} & \textsc{loc} \\ \midrule
    false   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    literal & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    local   & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    all     & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Examples for each situation are given in
Figure~\ref{fig:ES-distinguishing-pics}. Again there several possible
scenarios within each truth-value distribution, except for the literal
situation in \ref{fig:literal-GE}.

\section{Theories and predictions}
\label{sec:theories-predictions}

With some mild simplification, we can distinguish three main
theoretical positions that make different predictions about the
available and preferred readings of \as- and \es-sentences
\citep[c.f.][]{Geurts2010:Quantity-Implic,Sauerland2012:The-Computation}. We
will refer to these here as \mymark{traditionalism},
\mymark{conventionalism} and \mymark{grammaticalism} and treat each
one in turn. Since there is some leeway in assessing the predictions
for some of these positions (depending on which of several reasonable
additional assumptions we should adopt), we will distinguish different
varieties of traditionalism and grammaticalism. For convenience, the
predictions of each (variety of each) position are also summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:predictions} at the end of this section.

\subsection{Traditionalism}
\label{sec:traditionalism}

We refer to traditionalism as traditionalism because of its
conservative stance towards Grice's original theory of conversational
implicatures \citep{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}. Many author's have
defended traditionalist positions in this sense. Of the more recent
literature, we would consider as traditionalist, among others,
contributions such as by
\citet{Spector2006:Scalar-Implicat,Sauerland2004:Scalar-Implicat,Russell2006:Against-Grammat,vanRooijSchulz:ExhaustiveInterpretation,Geurts2010:Quantity-Implic,Franke2011:Quantity-Implic}. 

 According to Grice,
conversational implicatures, of which quantity/scalar implicatures are
a special case, are to be thought of as rationalizations of speaker
behavior. Central in this reasoning is the assumption that the
speaker's behavior is efficient (if not optimal) and
goal-oriented. Usually, the assumed goal of conversation is
cooperative exchange of helpful information from the speaker to the
hearer.

The Gricean recipe for deriving a simple scalar inference like that in
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target}) from an utterance of
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target}) is as follows: if the issue whether Hans
solved only some or all of the problem is relevant, then a cooperative
and knowledgable speaker would utter (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative})
if in a position to do so; hence, one of the most natural explanations
of why such a speaker has not uttered
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative}), but only (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target})
is that she is uncertain of whether (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative})
is true; but on the assumption that she is knowledgeable (competent,
opinionated, informed \dots) it follows that
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature}) should in fact be true.\fn{We are
  glossing here somewhat swiftly over the more nuanced details of the
  derivation of implicatures targeting the speaker's epistemic state
  \citep[e.g.][]{Gazdar1979:Pragmatics:-Imp,Soames1982:How-Presupposit},
  as this is not crucially relevant for the issues we are interested
  in here.}\textsuperscript{,}\dn{check this: what if subjects derived
  weak epistemic implicatures?}

\begin{exer}{bsp:Plain-SI}
  \ex 
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Target} Hans solved \mymark{some} of the problems.
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature} $\implicates$ Hans solved
        \mymark{some but not all} of the problems.
      \ex Hans solved \mymark{all} of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exer}

A similar line of reasoning applies immediately also to \as- and
\es-sentences and derives the global reading in a straightforward
way. Consequently, traditionalism predicts that both literal and
global readings are available: literal readings, because these form
the starting point of pragmatic reasoning; global readings because
these may be arrived at in the exact same manner by filling in the
Gricean recipe just mentioned. 

Whether traditionalism predicts that global readings are preferred
over literal ones or \emph{vice versa} depends on whether the
auxiliary assumptions necessary to derive global readings by the
Gricean recipe are plausible, namely: relevance of surplus
information, mutual awareness that the stronger alternative has been a
speaker option, the speaker's competence about the issue,
etc. Normally, traditionalist accounts would assume that these extra
assumptions are met. In that case, traditionalism would predict that
the global readings should be preferred over the literal readings. On
the other hand, it might also be hypothesized that, for example, a
competence assumption is harder to justify for \as- and \es-sentences
in general than for simpler sentences such as (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI}),
because of the additional quantificational element: it might be less
clear that the speaker knows exactly students solved how many
problems. In that case, or if any other assumption of the Gricean
recipe cannot be maintained, traditionalism would predict that the
literal reading would be preferred over the global one.

What about the local reading then? Here, the situation is slightly
different for \as- and the \es-sentences. Look at \es-sentences
first. Traditionalism does not predict that a local reading is
available for \es-sentences, at least not as a quantity implicature
\citep[c.f.][]{GeurtsPouscoulous2009:Embedded-Implic,ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev}. This
is because traditionalism assumes that quantity implicatures are
pragmatic enrichments of the literal meaning of an utterance, obtained
by conjoining the literal meaning with a suitable set of negated
alternatives. But since the literal and the local reading of
\es-sentences are logically independent, there is no way that local
readings can be derived in a traditionalist manner.

On the other hand, there is a traditionalist way of deriving the local
implicature for \as-sentences, namely if we assume that not only
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}) is an alternative to (\ref{bsp:AE}), but
also the sentences in (\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}).

\begin{exer}{bsp:AE}
  \ex \mymark{All} of the students solved \mymark{some} of the problems.
\end{exer}

\begin{exer}{bsp:AE-Alternative}
  \ex \mymark{All} of the students solved \mymark{all} of the problems.
\end{exer}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended} \mymark{Some} of the students solved \mymark{all} of the problems.
\end{exe}

\noindent Especially (\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) is
important here. Clearly, if we conjoin a literal reading of
(\ref{bsp:AE}) with the negation of
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) we obtain exactly the
local reading. (Notice that the negation of
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) entails the negation of
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}), so it makes no difference (not) to add it
in this case.) Consequently, traditionalism does predict that the
local reading of \as-sentences is available. 

Still, traditionalism would not predict that the local reading is
preferred. This is because the derivation of the local implicature via
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) hinges on another
auxiliary assumption, namely the availability of the alternative in
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}), which seems much less
obvious and therefore presumably is less readily available than the
alternative in (\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}). But if that is so, then the
local reading should, even if available, be less preferred than the
global reading.

Taken together, there are several varieties of standard traditionalism
that, depending on which additional assumptions we would make, yield
slightly different predictions. Let's distinguish these varieties with
handy labels as follows: \mymark{the strong variety of traditionalism}
maintains that the auxiliary assumptions of the Gricean recipe hold
usually/strongly/unless-completely-intenable and therefore predicts
that global readings are preferred over; \mymark{the weak variety of
  traditionalism} holds that the auxiliary assumptions are more
fragile and predicts that for \as- and \es-sentences the literal
reading is the preferred reading. Orthogonal to the strong/weak
distinction, we also consider another distinction: \mymark{restricted}
traditionalism assumes that (\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) is
not available and therefore predicts that the local reading for
\as-sentences is not available; in contrast, \mymark{unrestricted
  traditionalism} assumes that (\ref{bsp:AE-Alternatives-Extended}) is
available and so is the local reading. Predictions for all of these
traditionalist positions are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:predictions}.


\subsection{Conventionalism}
\label{sec:conventionalism}

Lexical conventionalism is a position that has been defended only by a
minority
\citep{LevinsonPresumptiveMeanings2000,Chierchia:2004_ScalarImplicatures}. This
notwithstanding, the position is \emph{prima facie} highly plausible
as well.\fn{Compare also \citet{Sauerland2012:The-Computation} who
  argues quite favorably for a pragmatically conscious
  conventionalism, although eventually dismissing it in favor of
  grammaticalism.} The general idea is that the upper-bounding
inference from \emph{some} to \emph{some but not all} occurs so
frequently that it would be inefficient to go over and over again
through the kind of Gricean reasoning that traditionalists
propose. Conventionalism therefore assumes that the scalar inferences
has become routinized, hard-wired, so much so that there are two
lexical entries for a scalar item like \emph{some}, one with meaning
\emph{some and maybe all} and one with the meaning \emph{some but not
  all}. 

\citet{LevinsonPresumptiveMeanings2000} proposed that the latter is
the preferred default meaning. Call this position
\mymark{defaultism}. Levinson's defaultism has strong empirical
evidence against is, because several processing studies show that the
computation of scalar inferences appears to be time- and
effort-consuming, when they \emph{do} arise, not when they
\emph{don't}, as defaultism would have it
\citep[c.f.][]{BrehenyKatsos2006:Are-Generalised,BrehenyKatsos2008:Experimental-In}.\dn{more
  references!} For completeness sake, let's call
\mymark{literalism}\dn{better name?} the opposite view that the
literal meanings are \emph{ceteris paribus} preferred. We are not
aware that anyone has defended this option, but we will come back to
this later on.

Both varieties of conventionalism make interesting predictions about
available readings for \as- and \es-sentences. Unaided,
conventionalism does not predict that global readings are
available. The lexically stored upper-bound for scalar \emph{some}
only allows to derive literal and local readings. If ---assuming this
against the strong evidence disfavoring this idea--- defaultism were
correct, then conventionalism would predict that local readings are
preferred. On the other hand, our dummy position of literalism, would
predict that literal readings are preferred.
