\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This paper deals with the interpretation of two types of
sentences, namely:

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:AE}
  \mymark{All} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\AE)
\ex \label{bsp:GE} 
  \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\GE)
\end{exe}

\noindent In \as-sentences the scalar item \emph{some} like takes
scope under universal quantifier \emph{all}. In \es-sentences
\emph{some} takes scope under non-monotonic quantifier \emph{exactly
  one}. These sentences are interesting, because, according to current
pragmatic theorizing, they may have at least three conceivable
readings. The main question we are interested in here is which of
these three conceivable readings is available to subjects na\"{i}ve to
all pragmatic theory. We are moreover interested in the more refined
question which of the available readings na\"{i}ve subjects prefer.

What are the possible readings of \as- and \es-sentences? Scalar
\emph{some} is usually assumed to receive a semantic interpretation
similar to logical $\exists$, so that the sentence \emph{Some boys
  cried} is literally true in a situation where all boys cried. But it
is also known to invite upper-bounding inferences in plain utterances:

\begin{exe}
  \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Target} Hans solved some of the problems.
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature} $\implicates$ Hans solved some but not all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent The classical explanation of this inference, following the
pioneering work of \citet{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}, has it that
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature}) is a pragmatic inference, a so-called
\emph{quantity implicature}, derived by an abductive inference as the
best explanation of why am informed, knowledgable and cooperative
speaker has uttered (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target}) when she could also
have uttered the semantically stronger and relevant:\dn{redo labels of
  examples}

\begin{exe}
  \exr{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \exi{c.} \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative} Hans solved all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent If this upper-bounding inference would occur often and
systematically enough, then it may well be that also embedded
occurrences of \emph{some} get enriched, in some fashion or other, to
contribute the enriched meaning \emph{some but not all} also under the
scope of other logical operators. Indeed, even
\citeauthor{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve} envisaged this possibility when
he wrote: ``It may not be impossible for what starts life, so to
speak, as a conversational implicature to become conventionalized''
\citep[p.58]{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}. But then there are at least
three relevant candidate readings for \as- and \es-sentences: (i) a
\emph{literal reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}) and
(\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}) where \emph{some} has only its literal meaning;
(ii) a \emph{global reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Global}) and
(\ref{bsp:GE-Global}) where, according to the Gricean intuition, we
enrich utterances of (\ref{bsp:AE}) and (\ref{bsp:GE}) with the
negation of alternativ utterances of the corresponding sentences
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Alternative}) where
\emph{some} is replaced by \emph{all}; and also (iii) a \emph{local
  reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Local}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Local}) where
\emph{some} is read to mean \emph{some but not all} in the scope of
the embedding quantifier.

\end{exe}

\noindent Section~\ref{sec:get-know-your} will discuss these reading
in more detail and, by giving some helpful illustrations, make clear
that these readings are all distinct but logically dependent
on each other in interesting ways.

The empirical questions we would like to ask, namely (i) which of
these readings are available, and (ii) which of the available ones are
the preferred interpretations, are highly relevant because they lie at
the heart of the current debate about the exact location and nature of
the interface between semantics and pragmatics. There are three major
camps which are ---more or less fiercely--- involved in this border
war, all of which make different predictions about availability and
preferences of readings. We will give a more detailed description of
the various theoretical positions below in
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}, but on a first rough
approximation the situation is the following. 

Firstly, there are \mymark{pragmatic traditionalists} who seek to
conserve the spirit of \citeauthor{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}'s
(\citeyear{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}) original ideas as much as
possible
\citep[e.g.][]{Spector2006:Scalar-Implicat,Sauerland2004:Scalar-Implicat,Russell2006:Against-Grammat,vanRooijSchulz:ExhaustiveInterpretation,Geurts2010:Quantity-Implic,Franke2011:Quantity-Implic}. Traditionalists
happily acknowledge the existence of global readings, but might
consider local readings either unavailable or a beast distinct from
scalar implicatures. An often phrased intuition of the traditionalists
is that local readings, since they are special kinds of inferences,
require special intonation, in particular emphatic stress on the
scalar item.\dn{give references}

Opposed to that is the camp of \mymark{lexical conventionalists}
\citep[e.g.][]{LevinsonPresumptiveMeanings2000,Chierchia:2004_ScalarImplicatures}
who maintain that scalar \emph{some} is lexically ambiguous between
the standard logical meaning \emph{some and maybe all} and the
upper-bounded meaning \emph{some but not all}. As the latter is
considered a default, lexical conventionalism has no problem
accounting for local readings, and in fact would consider these the
preferred readings. 

Thirdly and finally, there is the camp of \mymark{grammaticalists} who
defend that the distribution of upper-bounded readings of \emph{some}
is best explained by postulating a silent operator, akin to the
meaning of the particle \emph{only}
\citep{Chierchia2006:Broaden-Your-Vi,Fox2007:Free-Choice-and,Sauerland2012:The-Computation,ChierchiaFox2008:The-Grammatical,Chierchia2012:FC-Nominals-and}. According
to the grammatical view, this silent operator may be applied in
compositional semantics also in the scope of other logical operators,
but, so as not to overgenerate readings, the availability of readings
is constraint by the \emph{strongest meaning hypothesis}
\citep{DalrympleKanazawa1998:Reciprocal-Expr}. Grammaticalist theories
predict that all three types of readings are available. Moreover,
according to the grammatical view, the local reading is preferred for
\as-sentences, while the global one is preferred for
\es-sentences. (More precisely, as we will see
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}, depending on the variant of
the strongest meaning hypothesis employed, either the global reading
is predicted to be preferred for \es-sentences, or the global and the
local reading are predicted to be equally preferred.)

Due to its theoretical significance, a number of previous studies have
already probed into the availability of readings for \as- and
\es-sentences
\citep[e.g.][]{GeurtsPouscoulous2009:Embedded-Implic,CliftonDube2010:Embedded-Implic,ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev}. However,
as we will argue in Section~\ref{sec:previous-studies}, results have
not been as clear-cut as one might have hoped for. Even worse so,
taken in conjunction, the empirical evidence is inconclusive as to
whether local readings exist. We hypothesized that previous studies
might be insufficiently informative because of the focus on (variants
of) a picture-verification paradigm.\dn{relate to Bob van Tiel's
  work}  The problem is that in order to test the availability of
different candidate meanings different pictures have to be presented,
so that effects of pictorial complexity or stereotypicality could
never be ruled out entirely. Moreover, previous studies have only
accumulated limited evidence pertaining to the second question that
may help decide between theoretical positions, namely which of the
attested readings subjects prefer.

In reaction to this situation, we therefore studied a different mode
of visual presentation: subjects were presented with pictures that
were partly covered and could incrementally be uncovered at the
subjects' request; for each ((partially) covered) picture, subjects
had to decide whether they could already give a truth-value judgement
or needed more information.\dn{mention who else does this} This way we
obtained behavioral data that is both indicative of the reading
subjects assumed and independent of the complexity of the visual
stimulus. At the same time, we hypothesized that the incremental
nature of this task would shed light on the preferences over readings,
because the temporal distribution of truth-value judgments would give
away which reading subjects were waiting to evaluate, so to speak. To
test whether our method is indeed suitable to detect interpretation
preferences, we included ambiguous test items like
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler}) which are known to preferentially
receive the late-closure reading in
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler-LC}) and not the dispreferred, but
attested early-closure reading
(\ref{bsp:target-related-filler-EC}).\dn{insert references to
  literature on EC-LC processing}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler} The letter is connected with circles and squares with
  suns.
  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler-LC} The letter is connected
    with squares with suns and circles. \hfill (\LC)
  \ex \label{bsp:target-related-filler-EC} The letter is connected
    with circles with suns and squares with suns. \hfill (\EC)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent Finally, since it is often argued (see
Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions}) that intonational stress on an
embedded scalar item can favor a local reading we presented sentence
auditorily and manipulated stress accordingly. The design of our
studies is detailed in Section XYZ.

\begin{itemize}
\item summarize results
\end{itemize}

The paper is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sec:get-know-your}
elaborates on the three kinds of relevant readings for our target
sentences. Section~\ref{sec:theories-predictions} works out the
different theoretical positions and their predictions about
availability and preference. Section~\ref{sec:previous-studies} recaps
the results of previous studies on this subject, arguing for the need
of a more refined methodology. Section~\ref{sec:design} describes our
experimental design. Section~\ref{sec:results} states our results,
which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.\dn{rephrase

\section{Get to know your readings}
\label{sec:get-know-your}

Three readings are \emph{prima facie} conceivable for the \as- and
\es-sentences in (\ref{bsp:AE}) and (\ref{bsp:GE}). These are
logically distinct, but also logically dependent in intricate ways. To
see this, let us look at each kind of sentence in turn.

\subsection{\as-sentences}
\label{sec:as-sentences}

An \as-sentence like (\ref{bsp:AE}) has a literal reading as in
(\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}), a global reading as in (\ref{bsp:AE-Global})
and a local reading as in (\ref{bsp:AE-Local}).

\begin{exer}{bsp:AE}

  \ex \mymark{All} of the students read {\mymark{some}} of the
  papers. 

  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \mymark{All} of the students read
    {\mymark{some and maybe all}} of the papers. \hfill (\as-\lit)
  \ex
    \mymark{All} of the students read \mymark{some and maybe all} 
    and  \hfill (\as-\glb)\\
    it's not the case that \mymark{all} of the students read \mymark{all} of the papers.
  \ex
    \mymark{All} of the students read {\mymark{some  but not all}} of the
    papers. \hfill (\as-\loc)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exer}

\noindent These readings stand in a strict entailment relation,
namely the local reading asymmetrically entails the global reading,
which asymmetrically entails the literal reading:
\begin{exe}
  \ex \label{bsp:Entailments-AS} \loc $\subset$ \glb $\subset$ \lit
\end{exe}
That \glb $\subseteq$ \lit is obvious, given that \glb is defined as the
conjunction of \lit and the negated (relevant/feasible) alternative(s)
of the to-be-interpreted utterance. The entailment is asymmetric,
because the information that not all of the students read all of the
papers is not entailed by the literal reading. To see that \loc
$\subset$ \glb, notice that the case where all of the students read
some but not all of the papers is a special case of the case where all
of the students read some (and maybe all), while not all of the
students read all of the papers.

Given these entailment relations, there are four kinds of situations,
the names for which we borrow from
\citet{ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev}, that we can distinguish
based on different truth values for our candidate readings:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    situation    & \multicolumn{3}{c}{truth value} 
  \\ 
  \cmidrule(r){2-4}
     & \lit & \glb & \loc \\ \midrule
    false   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    literal & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    weak    & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    strong  & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Examples of these kinds of situations are given in
Figure~\ref{fig:AS-distinguishing-pics}, where the dots on the right
of each diagram are students, the dots on the left problems and an
arrow from a student to a problem indicates that that student sovled
that problem.\dn{improve graphics} Notice that, except for the literal
situation in
Figure~\ref{fig:literal-AE},
other arrangements of arrows might equally well serve as examples.

\subsection{\es-sentences}
\label{sec:es-sentences}

The situation for \es-sentences like (\ref{bsp:GE}) is similar, but a
little more complicated because the embedding quantifier is
non-monotonic. Again, we consider a literal reading as in
(\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}), a global reading as in (\ref{bsp:GE-Global})
and a local reading as in (\ref{bsp:GE-Local}).

\begin{exer}{bsp:GE}
\ex \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read {\mymark{some}} of the
  papers.

  \begin{xlist}
  \ex \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read
    {\mymark{some and maybe all}} of the papers. \hfill (\es-\lit)
  \ex 
    \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some and maybe all} 
    and  \hfill (\es-\glb)\\
    it's not the case that \mymark{exactly one} of the students read \mymark{all} of the papers.
  \ex 
    \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read {\mymark{some  but not all}} of the
    papers. \hfill (\es-\loc)
  \end{xlist}
\end{exer}

\noindent Entailment relations in this case are non-linear:
\begin{exe}
  \ex        \lit\ $\supset$ \glb\ $\color{mycol}{\subset}$ \loc 
    % \hspace{1cm} and \hspace{1cm}  \lit\ $\not \supset$ \loc
\end{exe}
Of course, $\glb \subseteq \lit$ by definition of global readings. But
the entailment is asymmetric, because the extra information that it is
not the case that exactly one student read all of the papers is not
entailed by the literal reading (\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}). However,
unlike for \as-sentences, \loc is not stronger than \glb, but
asymmetrically entailed by the latter. To see this, notice that the
global reading is equivalent to:

\begin{exe}
  \exp{bsp:GE-Global} \label{test} \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some but not
    all} and \\
  \mymark{everybody else} read \mymark{none} of the papers.
\end{exe}

\noindent This reformulation also makes clear that \loc and \lit are
logically independent.

Given these entailment relations, there are again four different
situations, named following \citet{ChemlaSpector2010:Experimental-Ev},
corresponding to the four possible distributions of truth values:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \toprule
    situation    & \multicolumn{3}{c}{truth value} 
  \\ 
  \cmidrule(r){2-4}
    & \textsc{lit} & \textsc{glb} & \textsc{loc} \\ \midrule
    false   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    literal & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    local   & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    all     & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Examples for each situation are given in
Figure~\ref{fig:ES-distinguishing-pics}. Again there several possible
scenarios within each truth-value distribution, except for the literal
situation in \ref{fig:literal-GE}.
