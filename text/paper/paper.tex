\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This paper deals with the interpretation of two types of
sentences, exemplified by:

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{bsp:AE}
  \mymark{All} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\AE)
\ex \label{bsp:GE} 
  \mymark{Exactly one} of the students read \mymark{some} of the
  papers. \hfill (\GE)
\end{exe}

\noindent In \as-sentences a scalar item \emph{some} takes scope under
a universal quantifier \emph{all}. In \es-sentences a scalar item
\emph{some} takes scope under a non-monotonic quantifier \emph{exactly
  one}. Scalar \emph{some} is usually assumed to receive a semantic
interpretation similar to logical $\exists$, so that the expression
\emph{Some boys cried.} is literally true in a situation where all
boys cried. But it is also known to invite upper-bounding inferences
in plain utterances:

\begin{exe}
  \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Target} Hans solved some of the problems.
      \ex \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature} $\implicates$ Hans solved some but not all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent The classical explanation of this inference, following the
pioneering work of \citet{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}, has it that
(\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Implicature}) is a pragmatic inference, a so-called
\emph{quantity implicature}, derived by an abductive inference as the
best explanation of why am informed, knowledgable and cooperative
speaker has uttered (\ref{bsp:Plain-SI-Target}) when she could also
have uttered the semantically stronger and relevant:\dn{redo labels of
  examples}

\begin{exe}
  \exr{bsp:Plain-SI}
    \begin{xlist}
      \exi{c.} \label{bsp:Plain-SI-Alternative} Hans solved all of the problems.
    \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent If this upper-bounding inference would occur often and
systematically enough, then it may well be that also embedded
occurrences of \emph{some} get enriched, in some fashion or other, to
contribute \emph{in situ} the enriched meaning \emph{some but not
  all}. Indeed, even \citeauthor{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve} envisaged
this possibility when he wrote: ``It may not be impossible for what
starts life, so to speak, as a conversational implicature to become
conventionalized'' \citep[p.58]{Grice1975:Logic-and-Conve}. But then
there are at least three relevant candidate readings for \as- and
\es-sentences: (i) a \emph{literal reading} like in
(\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}) where \emph{some}
has only its literal meaning as in; (ii) a \emph{global reading} like
in (\ref{bsp:AE-Literal}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Literal}) where, according
to the Gricean intuition, we compare utterances of (\ref{bsp:AE}) or
(\ref{bsp:GE}) with utterances of the corresponding sentences
(\ref{bsp:AE-Alternative}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Alternative}) where
\emph{some} is replaced by \emph{all}; and also (iii) a \emph{local
  reading} like in (\ref{bsp:AE-Local}) and (\ref{bsp:GE-Local}) where
\emph{some} is read to mean \emph{some but not all} in the scope of
the embedding quantifier.
