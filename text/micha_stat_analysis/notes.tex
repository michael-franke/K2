\section{Target Conditions}
\label{sec:target-conditions}

Each participant saw each critical sentence type three times with
neutral and three times with constrastive stress intonation on the
scalar item. We coded judgements as either \emph{literal},
\emph{local}, \emph{global} or \emph{false}. Contingency tables of the
observed frequencies are in Table~\ref{tab:CC-ContingencyTable}.

Two things strike the eye. Firstly, there are hardly any \emph{global}
responses. For subsequent analysis in terms of log-linear models we
must therefore lump together \emph{global} and \emph{false} responses
into one more general category \emph{other}. Secondly, the number of
\emph{false} responses drops remarkably in the \es-conditions. The
following analysis should probe into this potential position effect.


If we only look at the very first judgement that subjects gave to a
target condition, we obtain the following table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
    & \emph{literal} & \emph{local} & \emph{global} & \emph{false} \\
    \midrule
    accented & 15 &  5 & 0 &  9 \\
    neutral  &  6 &  0 & 0 &  2 \\ \addlinespace[0.15cm]
    Total    & 21 &  5 & 0 & 11
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Notably, nobody gave a \emph{local} answer on the first encounter of a
target condition with neutral accentuation. Still, Pearson's $\chi^2$
test does not reject the null hypothesis of an equal distribution of
readings ($\chi^2 = 2.0546$, $p \approx 0.4318$).  \todo[inline]{Is
  this test applicable at all? Don't we have too little data points?
  How else could a dependence be tested in this case?}

To test which factors are relevant to explain the data distribution in
Table~\ref{tab:CC-ContingencyTable}, we compute log-linear models
\citep{KnokeBurke1980:Log-Linear-Mode}. The relevant factors are
\textsc{Position}, \textsc{Response}, \textsc{Condition}, and
\textsc{Accent}. To ensure applicability, we lump levels \emph{global}
and \emph{false} of factor \textsc{Response} into a single level
\emph{other}. The best predictor of the data takes all factors
\textsc{Position}, \textsc{Response} and \textsc{Condition} and all
their interactions into account ($\chi^2 = 7.493$, $df=18$, $p =
0.985$, $AIC = 43.493$ (compared to $AIC=72$ of the saturated
model)). Crucially, factor \textsc{Accent} is spurious.

To test whether the effect of \textsc{Condition} could be due to the
relatively high number of \emph{false} responses in the
\es-conditions, we regrouped the factor \textsc{Response} once more to
distinguish only \emph{local} responses from \emph{other}
responses. Doing so allows us to address the question whether the
amount of \emph{local} responses differed across conditions and
accentuation types. But this does not seem to be the case. The
smallest model that predicts the data well in this case contains
factors \textsc{Response} and \textsc{Position} and their two-way
interaction ($\chi^2 = 4.71$, $df=18$, $p = 0.999$, $AIC = 16.711$
(compared to $AIC=48$ of the saturated model)). This suggests that a
shift in the distribution of \emph{local} responses can be
satisfactorily explained as a position effect across conditions: later
trials yielded less \emph{other} responses.

To test, then, whether this prediction is the result of an decrease of
\emph{false} responses in later trials or an actual shift in the
distribution between \emph{literal} and \emph{local} distribution, we
also computed the best log-linear predictor for the subset of our data
including only \emph{literal} and \emph{local} responses. Doing so,
the best predictor indeed drops factor \textsc{Position} and contains
only factors \textsc{Response} and \textsc{Condition} and their
two-way interaction ($\chi^2 = 12.497$, $df=20$, $p = 0.898$, $AIC =
20.497$ (compared to $AIC=48$ of the saturated model)). This suggests
that the factor \textsc{Position} is not relevant for explaining the
distribution of \emph{literal} and \emph{local} readings. Its effects
noted previously are most likely due to the decrease of \emph{false}
responses in later trials of the \es-conditions.
